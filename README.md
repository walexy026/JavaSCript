# JavaSCript
calculating using array
# BOOTSTRAP TABLE
I used bootstrap to create a responsive table to all screen, applying the hover effect on the table rows
# functions
1. alert function- this would ensure that once the page is loaded it display, it display a pop up message
2. prompt function- this is a form like effect on Javascrpit which allows user input data which would be stored and displayed on the table
3. the innerHTML function allows the JavaScript to connect to the HTML files to dispay whatever input on the liveserver
4. const- it is a data type which stored variables which would not change
5. console.log- it allows the information input to display on the console
